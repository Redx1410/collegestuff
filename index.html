    <h1>CSE College Showdown: Best B.Tech Choices Compared</h1>
    <p>My though process behind choosing and analyzing top engineering colleges for Computer Science (CSE) in which I have a chance to get in with a focus on overall value, placements, reputation, and proximity to Gurgaon.</p>

    <h2>What Are NIRF Tiers?</h2>
    <p>The NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) by the Government of India evaluates colleges based on teaching, learning, resources, research, graduation outcomes, and perception. Tiers are often used informally to classify colleges based on these and other market factors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Top-ranked institutions with excellent academics, research, and placements. Includes IITs, NITs, BITS, and top private universities like VIT (in engineering).</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Good private and public institutions with solid placements and industry links. Includes MUJ, NMIMS, SRM.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Regional colleges that may offer good local opportunities but lack national brand pull. Includes KIET and Chitkara.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Why MUJ Is the Best Fit for Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brand Strength:</strong> Part of the Manipal group, which is globally respected in education.</li>
            <li><strong>Excellent CSE Placements:</strong> Higher average and median CTC compared to most colleges in this list.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced Cost and Location:</strong> Close enough to visit home during holidays; not as expensive as NMIMS or VIT.</li>
            <li><strong>Focused CSE Program:</strong> Projects, internships, and events dedicated to computer science students.</li>
            <li><strong>NIRF Tier 2 with Tier 1 performance in CS:</strong> Despite being Tier 2 officially, its placement performance and industry relevance place it among Tier 1 performers in CS.</li>
            <li><strong>Better Fit than NMIMS:</strong> NMIMS is farther, costlier, and prioritizes MBA programs. CS is not its flagship, making it less ideal for core tech jobs, especially for someone from Gurgaon.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Understanding What You'll Learn in B.Tech CSE</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Math in CS (Very Important)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discrete Mathematics:</strong> Sets, logic, graphs, combinatorics – core of algorithms and logic building.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Vectors, matrices, systems – critical in AI, ML, graphics.</li>
            <li><strong>Probability & Statistics:</strong> Needed for data science and AI (Bayes' theorem, distributions, standard deviation).</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Calculus:</strong> Some differentiation and integration – useful in optimization problems in ML.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key point:</strong> This is completely different from the math in 12th CBSE. It's logic-heavy and more practical for CS.</p>

        <h3>Physics in CS (Mostly Irrelevant)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic digital electronics and logic gates in 1st year (easy to grasp, logic-based).</li>
            <li>No electromagnetism or mechanics unless you pick hardware electives (rare).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Physics is minimal, only in a few optional areas. Nothing like 12th grade physics.</p>

        <h3>Chemistry in CS</h3>
        <p><strong>None at all.</strong> You will not study chemistry in CS. It's entirely irrelevant to the stream.</p>

        <h3>My Own Experience</h3>
        <p>I got 92 in AI and scored well in English too — the subjects I enjoyed. This proves when I’m genuinely interested, I can excel. My lower scores in PCM were not because I can’t do well, but because I didn’t find them as engaging.</p>
        <p>B.Tech CSE focuses on logic, programming, problem solving, and creativity — not rote memorization like in boards. So past school performance doesn’t define my future in CS.</p>
